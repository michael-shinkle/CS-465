### Architecture
Express HTML: Express HTML is a server-side web application framework. It is used to create and manage dynamic web content by using the HTML template language. It is used to create the user interface of a website and provide the basic structure of a website.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language which is used to create dynamic web content. It is used to create interactive webpages and applications. JavaScript is used to add animation, create user interactions and validate user input.

Single-Page Application (SPA): A single-page application (SPA) is an application that functions within a single web page, in this case creating using the Angular framework. It is used to provide a more dynamic and interactive user experience. It can be used to create webpages that can handle complex user interactions and provide a more fluid user experience.

Both Express HTML and JavaScript are used to create dynamic web content, however, Express HTML is used to create the user interface of a website while JavaScript is used to create the interactive elements. A single-page application (SPA) is different from Express HTML and JavaScript in that it is used to create an entire application within a single web page. It is used to create a more dynamic and interactive user experience than a traditional web page.

NoSQL databases like MongoDB are well suited for applications that require a high level of scalability and flexibility. MongoDB stores data in collections of documents, which makes it easy to access and update data as needed. MongoDB also has a robust query language and advanced indexing capabilities, allowing developers to quickly query large datasets and build complex applications. Finally, MongoDB is designed with high availability and fault tolerance in mind, making it a good choice for applications that need to remain operational even in the face of hardware or network failures.

### Functionality

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a language-independent, text-based format that is designed to be easily read and written by humans and machines. JSON is commonly used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. JSON is a standard format for storing and exchanging data, and is often used in conjunction with web services and APIs.

JSON is used to tie together the frontend and backend development pieces. The frontend (client-side) of an application will typically use JSON to communicate with the backend (server-side) of an application. The frontend will send a request in the form of a JSON document, and the backend will respond with a JSON document. This allows for an efficient exchange of data between the two sides.

There were several points in this project that were refactored from the original code. The majority of this was abstracting the original static html into components and using MongoDB to serve the data to the customer facing website. Refactoring code to improve functionality and efficiencies involved changing the underlying structure of the code without changing the external behavior. This process often included replacing inefficient code with more efficient code, restructuring code so that it was easier to understand and maintain, and introducing new features to improve the user experience.

### Testing
Methods, endpoints, and security are all integral components of a full stack application. Endpoints are particular locations within the application, such as a URL, that a user can access to perform an operation. Security measures are implemented to protect the application and the data within it from unauthorized access or manipulation.

To test the methods, endpoints, and security within a full stack application, a variety of API testing techniques may be used. This includes testing the application's interfaces, such as web services, to ensure that the methods and endpoints are working correctly. Additionally, security measures, such as authentication and authorization, can be tested to ensure that only authorized users can access the application or certain parts of it. This type of testing may also involve testing the application for vulnerabilities and other potential security risks.

### Reflection
This course has helped me to develop my communication, problem solving, and analytical skills. These are all essential skills for any developer in the software development field. I have developed my ability to think critically and independently, which has helped me to better understand complex problems and to identify solutions. I have also developed my ability to effectively collaborate with others, which is essential for any team-based work. Overall, this course has helped me to become a more marketable candidate in my career field by providing me with the necessary skills to effectively interact with clients, peers, and colleagues.
